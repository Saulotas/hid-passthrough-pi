# HID Passthrough Pi

This project allows you to use a **Raspberry Pi Zero W** (or similar Raspberry Pi) as a **USB HID passthrough device**. The Pi acts as a bridge to forward keyboard input (wired USB) to a **Bluetooth-connected** device. This setup allows for seamless keyboard connectivity between a **USB keyboard** and a **Bluetooth-enabled PC** or **smartphone**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features:
- **USB HID passthrough**: Wired keyboard to Bluetooth device.
- **Automatic pairing**: The Pi will automatically pair with a Bluetooth device.
- **LED status**: Visual indication of Bluetooth connection using an LED.
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) updates**: Keep your Pi up-to-date automatically.
